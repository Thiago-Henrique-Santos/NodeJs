# Learning NodeJs

On this repository I'm writting my progress learning node.js while I create an API with this technology wich conects to a json file database about my days learning node.js.

* **Note:** I stopped learning node.js for a while because I had some time management problems, months ago, and now I'm gonna focusing on learning some essentials Javascript's objects, functions and methods for node.js (Promises, Async and Await as examples) before continue learning it.
